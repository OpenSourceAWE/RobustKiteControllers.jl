    load_yaml_fields!(obj, filename, section; path = rkc_data_path()) -> obj

Set every field `section` (a top-level key in the YAML file `filename`) names
on the mutable struct `obj`, converting each value to the field's declared
type; `filename` is resolved under `path` unless already absolute. An unknown
key errors, a key the file omits leaves `obj`'s existing value (its struct
default, for a freshly constructed `obj`) untouched. A key in
[`RETIRED_YAML_KEYS`](@ref) is skipped if it has the value listed there and
errors otherwise, so archived settings files still load.

Purely reflective (`hasfield`/`setfield!`/`fieldtype` on `typeof(obj)`), so it
works on any mutable struct without `src/` depending on the struct's package.

`WCSettings` in `examples/simple_reelout.jl` until the 2026-08-16 winch merge
gave that struct a single file reached through the project's `wc_settings:` key
(PlanWinchcontrol.md), which is V3Kite's `WC_Settings(filename)`'s job now.

WHICH frequencies the drum yields to, not by how much.

Plain numbers on purpose. The scaling is the part worth keeping in this package;
the controller object it feeds belongs to the kite model, which this package
