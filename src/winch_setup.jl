    load_wc_settings(filename; dt) -> WCSettings

Load winch-controller settings from the YAML file `filename`, looked up under
the active data path (`joinpath(get_data_path(), filename)`) unless absolute.
The file must have a top-level `wc_settings:` mapping whose keys are fields of
`WCSettings`; a missing key keeps the struct default, an unknown key errors.

This used to be V3Kite's own `WC_Settings(filename)`. It lives in RobustKiteControllers now because
the struct belongs to WinchControllers.jl and the *file* belongs to the run —
V3Kite itself no longer reads winch gains at all. `dt` always wins over the
file's placeholder value: it is the plant's timestep, not a tuning choice.

`rc` (built after `init`, so its soft-start ramp begins when reel-out starts; `rcs` is the
one `WCSettings` of both winches), the nominal force ceiling `f_high_nominal` captured
before the first-lap reduction (`winch_from_wc` sends this one to the optimizer), the
standalone force-floor guard for phases 0-2 (`rc`'s own `SpeedController` would wind up
while its output is ignored), the length setpoint `l_set` (the settled length, growing
from phase 3 until it reaches `reelout_l_max`) and the figure-of-eight controller `fec`.

Of the model it reads only `s.dt` and `s.sys_state.l_tether`, so it takes any plant.
