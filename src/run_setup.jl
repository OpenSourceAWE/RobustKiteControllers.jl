# The setup of one reel-out run of examples/simple_opt_reelout.jl, and its finished-run marker.

"""
    RunSetup

Everything one reel-out run of `examples/simple_opt_reelout.jl` READS, built once by
[`setup_run`](@ref): the settings, the plant `s`, the winch and its controllers, the optimizer's
conditions and session, and the laws the gates and the loop read. Every function of the run takes it
as `setup` and reads `setup.<field>` or destructures it. The script never rebinds it; mutable members
(`fcs`, `wc`, `s`, `fec`, the `opt_*_log` vectors, ...) are changed in place.

The last block of fields is filled later, by the startup solve ([`solve_startup_path!`](@ref)) and
the startup gates ([`startup_feasibility`](@ref)), through [`merge_into!`](@ref); until then they
hold their defaults. The type parameters are the plant's type `S`, which the package does not know,
and the two turn-rate laws, read every step, so that the loop compiles against their concrete types.

The block functions of the run read their fields by name only, so a `NamedTuple` with the fields a
function reads serves as well (the unit tests build them that way).

only ever sees the success path waits forever on a run that crashed (measured: a
GLMakie main-thread error in the plots, long after the simulation had finished
and the log was safely written).

`status` is `ok`, `ok (plots failed)` or `FAILED`; on failure the exception's
first line follows on an `error:` line. The other fields come from `st`, where
`reelout_results` keeps them as soon as they are known: a crash early enough leaves
them at their defaults, and the marker still has to be writable.
