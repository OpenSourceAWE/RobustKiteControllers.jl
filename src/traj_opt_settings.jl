"""
    TrajOptSettings

Settings of a run flown along an EXTERNALLY optimized path
(`examples/simple_opt_fig8.jl`, `examples/simple_opt_reelout.jl`): where the AWETrim
server is, the initial guess the solve starts from, the box it solves under, and the
gates the path that comes back must pass. Loaded from `data/traj_opt.yaml` the same way
[`FC_Settings`](@ref) is loaded from its own — a run is defined by a file, not by editing
a script. The settings are split by what reads them; each part is its own struct and its
own section of the YAML file.

A field is reached through its part, e.g. `tos.box.pattern_azimuth_max`. The field names
are unique over all parts, so the constructors and [`apply_overrides!`](@ref) also take a
field by its bare name: `TrajOptSettings(; min_height = 40.0)`.

The conditions are NOT here: the wind comes from the system project's settings
file and the winch law from its `wc_settings`, both read off the same files the
plant is built from (`inflow_from_settings`, `winch_from_wc` in
`awetrim_client.jl`). A path optimized for a wind the kite does not fly
in is not the path for the run.

The **initial guess is not a formality**, which is why it has its own fields here
rather than borrowing `FC_Settings`' `f8_a`/`f8_b`/`el_center`. Those size the
lemniscate that `simple_fig8.jl` and `simple_reelout.jl` actually FLY; here the
lemniscate is only a seed, and the two roles pull in different directions.
Measured 2026-08-18 at 150 m and 6 m/s: the reel-out pattern (20°/11° at 18°)
makes the solve fail to converge, while 30°/12°, or the same eight centred at
26°, converge — and to the same optimum, worth 6080 W, while the server's own
parametric guess converges to a different one worth 1431 W. The problem is
multi-modal, so the guess is a choice about the answer.

    opt_length(l) -> Float64

Tether length to SEND to the optimizer, rounded to [`OPT_LENGTH_ROUND`](@ref) [m].
The flown `l_set` is never rounded.

Every constraint that depends on the length is sized at this one too, not at the
flown length: the settled `l_set` moves in the 5th decimal with the plant
(150.00282 against 150.00290 m after the SymbolicAWEModels 0.18 bump), and a
`min_turn_radius` changed by 1e-7 of itself missed the failure cache and flipped
which startup seed converges, and so which of two optima the run flew
(2026-09-26, 10 m/s: path centre 26.7° or 40.8°).
