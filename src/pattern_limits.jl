                  azimuth_amplitude_min, elevation_amplitude_max, symmetric,
                  climb_angle_max)

A box, in DEGREES, on where the optimized pattern may go. The server bounds the
B-spline's control coefficients, so by the convex-hull property the limits hold
along the whole curve and not merely at its nodes.

Every field is optional and `nothing` keeps the optimizer's own default for it
(|azimuth| <= 45.8°, 0.6° <= elevation <= 51.6°, no amplitude floor).
`azimuth_amplitude_min` is the figure's half-width and guards the degenerate
zero-width collapse; `elevation_max` guards the run-away-to-zenith basin — the
two bad basins a failed re-optimization falls into. `elevation_amplitude_max`
caps the figure's elevation HALF-SPAN with one smooth row (mean squared
deviation from the mean elevation <= value²/2) — where `elevation_max` only
caps where the path may sit, this caps how TALL it is. `symmetric = true`
forces a figure mirror-symmetric about azimuth 0 (half a period later the kite
is at the mirrored point). `climb_angle_max` caps how steeply the path may
CLIMB in the azimuth/elevation plane (elevation rising along the flight
direction: d(elevation) <= tan(value) * |d(azimuth)|, plain angles); descending
is free, so the vertical dives at the sides stay allowed. On `/step` the struct
replaces the session's limits as a whole, so an all-`nothing` `PatternLimits()`
CLEARS them.

The elevation floor [deg] to send with a request made for tether length
`l_tether`: the highest of what the gates will demand there —
`asind(tos.gates.min_height/l_tether)` for the clearance one and `fcs.run.min_elevation +
tos.gates.candidate_elevation_margin` for the elevation one — plus `extra`. `nothing`
asks for nothing and leaves the optimizer's own 0.6°.

Inverting [`path_min_height`](@ref) at the length being asked for is what makes
the request and the gate the same question: AWETrim constrains HEIGHT and reaches
its floor at the END of the lap's reel-out, while the reply is installed as angles
at the anchor and judged there. The floor FALLS as the tether grows, so it belongs
with every request and not in the session — see the analogous argument for
`min_turn_radius` at the request site.

`extra` is what a retry raises the floor by after a reply was gated out, measured
off that reply and carried forward: the shortfall is structural and the next
length has it too.
