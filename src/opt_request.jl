clamped to [`DEPOWER_SEED_BOUNDS`](@ref) and, below that, to
`tos.seed.input_depower_seed_max` when it is set.

A seed landing exactly on `DEPOWER_SEED_BOUNDS`' hard ceiling is itself a
failure mode, not just a value: measured 2026-08-20 at 150 m / 10 m/s, the ramp
wants 2.35 m, clamps to 2.3 m, and `/step` then runs to IPOPT's iteration cap
with no room left to move — `input_depower_seed_max` caps the ramp short of
that ceiling instead.

Only a seed — `depower_mode` stays `"optimize"` and the server moves it — but the
seed is what decides whether the solve gets anywhere, because the AoA cap of 14°
is already binding at 6 m/s and the solve has to start on the feasible side of it.
Measured 2026-08-20 at 150 m: from 1.6 m, 6 m/s solved stage 1 of `/step` in
0.85 s and 21 iterations; 8 m/s hit the iteration cap with AoA at -25…88° and
took the constrained stage 2 down with it (422). Stage 1 carries no turn-radius
constraint, so this is not the `min_turn_radius` request going too far — the same
12.20 m ask solved at 6 m/s eighteen minutes earlier.

ONE-SIDED on purpose. Less wind would want less tape, but every run of the
5.0-7.0 m/s scan in `docs/wind_scan_results.yaml` converged from 1.6 m, and
seeding those lower would move answers that are already measured. The ramp only
adds where nothing has been flown.

The slope is anchored on two points, so treat it as provisional: 1.6 m is the
largest seed known to converge (7.0 m/s, that scan) and 1.85 m is what 8 m/s was
first solved with. A third measured wind should replace it rather than extend it.

The seed is a poor estimate: it is ramped on the 6 m wind for the solve to CONVERGE, and the
sites differ in shear, so Maasvlakte 8 m/s was seeded at 1.85 m and flew 1.42-1.46 m. With
the drag of the wing in the plant (`wing_drag_coeff`) the depower conversion maps a tape
length onto more depower, where the kite turns worse, and the request sized at the seed
asked for a turn radius no pattern in the box could meet (2026-10-05). Only the estimate is
moved; the seed the solve starts from is not.

    min_turn_radius_request(fcs, tos; scale = 1.0, c1 = nothing,
                            margin = tos.gates.min_feasibility_margin) -> Union{Float64, Nothing}

`margin` in METRES — `margin/(c1*max_steering)`, the kite's own physical turning
limit scaled by the margin — sent WITH the request so the optimizer cannot answer
with a pattern that is about to be rejected. Defaults to `tos.gates.min_feasibility_margin`;
pass a smaller value to ask for less than the full gate, e.g. a graduated startup
retry. `nothing` — send no constraint — when `margin` is 0, which is also where the
gate is off.

`scale` asks for MORE than that, and a reel-out run has to: the two numbers do not
measure the same curve at the same radius, and the difference is NOT in the run's
favour. Pass `reelout_anchor_ratio(table) * tos.gates.turn_radius_headroom`.

The optimizer enforces `R = r/|kappa|` at each node's OWN radius, and `r` grows
through the lap — it starts at the anchor and reels out. The run installs the reply
as a fixed (azimuth, elevation) curve and flies it at the ANCHOR, where the same
angular curvature is physically tighter by `L/r`. Measured 2026-08-19 on a reply
anchored at 380 m: `distance_radial` spanned 380.0 -> 415.0 m, the tightest node sat
at r = 411 m with R = 12.32 m, and that curve at the 380 m anchor is 11.38 m — 0.92x.
The factor is `L/(L+dL)` with `dL` the lap's reel-out, so it BITES HARDEST AT THE
SHORT END: ~0.87 at 220 m against ~0.92 at 380 m. `reelout_anchor_ratio` measures
`1 + dL/L` off a reply and is the geometric half of `scale`.

On top of that the gate re-estimates the curvature from the reply's ~99 points
(`path_radius_profile`, a finite difference on the resampled polyline) and reads
~5 % tighter than the exact anchor value — 10.81 m against 11.38 m on the same
reply — and the run then adds `el_offset_wing` before checking, which
compresses the azimuth axis by `cos(elevation)` a little more.
`tos.gates.turn_radius_headroom` covers that half.

Both together are why an unscaled request came back at margin 0.63 against a
`min_feasibility_margin` of 0.74, converged and with its constraint satisfied
(2026-08-19, L = 220 m). The scaled request costs a slightly wider pattern, i.e. a
little power; it does not make the gate any weaker, which still scores the curve
that will actually be flown.

The conversion itself is exact: the gate's margin is a RATIO of two angular radii
at one tether length, and scaling both by that length turns it into a ratio of
physical ones, with the kite's physical minimum `1/(c1*u_s)` = 11.35 m at
`c1 = 0.2752`, `u_s = 0.32`. That much IS length-free — what is not is where the
optimizer measures the path's own radius.

`c1` defaults to the identified turn-rate table at `fcs.course.depower_setpoint`, which is
the turn authority the pattern is flown with. PASS THE ONE THE GATE WILL USE: from
phase 5 the run flies `depower_final`, where c1 is ~23 % lower (0.2133 against
0.2752), and a request made at the pattern's c1 is then ~23 % short of what the
reply will be judged against — measured 2026-08-20, a reply of 12.15 m answering a
10.37 m request and rejected at margin 0.61, which is exactly `0.74 * c1_final/c1`
of the 0.79 it would have scored in phase 4. [`c1_at`](@ref)`(feas, phase, c1)`
is that number.

The table refuses to extrapolate off its grid. A `body_damping`/`depower_setpoint`
it cannot serve therefore sends no constraint and warns, exactly as the feasibility
GATE degrades — an off-grid run loses the advice, not the run.

the gate's headroom in `opt_r_scale`; `nothing` when off, for margin 0 or an off-grid

own and so unknown before the solve; [`request_depower_estimate`](@ref) estimates it from the
wind aloft (or takes the seed). The setpoint is NOT an estimate: it is the depower the loop is
tuned at, typically far more powered, and a request sized there comes back a third too tight
