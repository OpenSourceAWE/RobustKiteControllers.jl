    low_wind_schedule(fcs::FC_Settings, v_ref) -> Union{NamedTuple, Nothing}

What to fly at the wind speed `v_ref` [m/s] at `fcs.low_wind.low_wind_height`:
`(; l_tether, guess_el_center)`, linear between the
rows of `fcs.low_wind` ([`FC_LowWind`](@ref)) and the first row's values below it.
`nothing` at and above the last row's wind speed, and for an empty schedule: the
settings files' own values are flown there.

Keyed on the wind at height and not at `h_ref`, because that orders the sites by what
the kite meets: Cabauw's 3 m/s is 5.8 m/s at 100 m, Maasvlakte's 3.5 m/s only 4.5 m/s
(2026-10-02). Errors for vectors of unequal length or wind speeds that do not ascend.

    apply_low_wind_schedule!(fcs, tos, project_set; keep = ()) -> NamedTuple

Overwrite the starting tether length `project_set.l_tether` and `tos.guess.guess_el_center` with
[`low_wind_schedule`](@ref) at [`low_wind_reference`](@ref), and the starting length alone with
`fcs.low_wind.high_wind_l_tether` at and above `fcs.low_wind.high_wind_speed`. A name in `keep` (e.g. the
keys of a run's overrides) is left alone; `tos = nothing` skips the guess, for a caller
without the optimizer's settings. Call it once, after the wind-speed override and
before anything is built from the settings. Returns `(; v_ref, values)`, `values`
being what was applied, or `nothing` when the schedule is off at this wind.

Warns when the last row differs from the settings files' own values: the schedule then
steps at its last wind speed.
