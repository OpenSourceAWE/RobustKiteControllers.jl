    winch_table_lookup(v_wind, key; project = project_file()) -> Float64

Linearly interpolate column `key` of the system project's `winch_table` file
([`winch_table_file`](@ref)) against mean wind speed. Clamped to the
lowest/highest identified wind speed outside that range, never extrapolated.
Only reel-out projects carry a `winch_table` entry, so calling this against a
fig8 project throws, as does a table missing `key` in any row.

    winch_f_low(v_wind; project = project_file()) -> Float64

Wind-speed-dependent force floor [N] below which WinchControllers.jl's
`LowerForceController` reels in, from the `f_low` column of the project's
`winch_table` file (see [`winch_table_lookup`](@ref)). Overrides the flat
`f_low` of `data/wc_settings.yaml`; the caller assigns the result to
`WCSettings.f_low`.

It is wind-dependent because the two things it sits between scale differently:
the winch's rating does not move with the wind, while the force a kite can
produce goes with its square. A single value sized for strong wind takes over
the run in weak wind — measured at 3 m/s, `f_low` 700 N put the limiter in
control 63 % of the time against 21 % at 350 N. NOT the entry guard's floor,
which is `FC_Settings.winch.entry_f_min`; see `docs/fig8_tuning_log.md`.

    winch_kv(v_wind; project = project_file()) -> Float64

Wind-speed-dependent gain of the reel-out law `v_set = kv * sqrt(force)`, from the `kv`
column of the project's `winch_table` file (see [`winch_table_lookup`](@ref)). Overrides
the flat `kv` of `data/wc_settings.yaml`; the caller assigns it to `WCSettings.kv`, which
the winch flies and the optimizer requests send alike. A lower `kv` reels out slower, so
the kite keeps more of a weak wind.

    winch_table_select(v_wind, key; project = project_file()) -> Any

Step-lookup of column `key`: the value of the LAST row at or below `v_wind`,
clamped to the first row below the identified range. The counterpart of
[`winch_table_lookup`](@ref) for columns that cannot be interpolated — a setting
is one thing or another at a given wind speed, never 40 % of the way between them.

"""
    winch_force_limit(v_wind; project = project_file()) -> String

Wind-speed-dependent `WCSettings.force_limit`, `"hard"` or `"soft"`, from the
`force_limit` column of the project's `winch_table` file (see
[`winch_table_select`](@ref)). Overrides the flat value of `data/wc_settings.yaml`,
which is `"hard"` so that a script not consulting this table gets the safe law.

It has to be wind-dependent because the soft law is only DEFINED over part of the
range. It inverts the optimizer's tension curve, whose effective floor is
`sp(beta*f_low)/beta` — 884 N at `f_low` 350 — and at `beta` 1e-3 that floor cannot
go below `ln(2)/beta` = 693 N for ANY `f_low`. The whole 3 m/s force range is
587 +- 165 N, i.e. below the floor, where the law commands a standstill and the run
reels in instead of out. Raising `beta` to move the floor is CLOSED: 2e-3 and 5e-3
both make the 3 m/s solve fail outright. So low wind gets the hard law, and the
soft law is used where it was measured — see `docs/fig8_tuning_log.md`.
