What the corrected startup retries know so far, starting from the incumbent's measured margin
`m_reply`. Each field is what the answers to the asks so far imply:

- `r_asked`: turn radius of the last ask that CONVERGED (`NaN` before any did) and `m_reply`
  the measured margin of that reply.
- `bisect_hi`: narrowest radius ask KNOWN to 422 (`NaN`: none yet).
- `cap_ok`: elevation ceiling of the last CONVERGED ask (`nothing`: none), `cap_bad` the highest
  ceiling KNOWN to 422 (`NaN`: none yet) and `relax_cap` whether to retry under `cap_ok`
  instead of ratcheting the ceiling down further.
- `width_ok`, `width_bad`, `relax_width`: the same for the azimuth half-width floor.

    next_lever(ladder, tos, inc_az, inc_el, opt_r_sent, box_el_min, el_floor_start,
               radius_for_margin) -> NamedTuple

The next ask of the ladder, one lever per attempt, from the path `(inc_az, inc_el)` [deg] of
the incumbent. `tos` supplies `min_feasibility_margin`, the step sizes are the
`STARTUP_RETRY_*` constants; `opt_r_sent` is the radius the startup solve was SENT (the
last ask that converged, before any retry did); `box_el_min` the elevation floor of the request's
box (`nothing`: none, `el_floor_start` is used) and `radius_for_margin(target)` the turn radius
the request builder asks for a margin `target`.

Returns `(; lever, r_ask, el_cap, az_min, target, prev_ask, inc_top, inc_height, inc_amp,
el_min_box, bisect_room)`, with `lever` one of `"radius bisection"`, `"radius correction"`,
`"ceiling step"`, `"width step"` and `"radius step"`; `el_cap` and `az_min` are `nothing` when
the ask leaves that side of the box alone. `lever === nothing` (then only `prev_ask` and
`bisect_room` are set) when nothing is left to try: no radius under the one that 422'd can reach
the gate, and the ceiling and width levers are spent.
