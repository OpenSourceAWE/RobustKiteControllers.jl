# Julia client for the AWETrim reelout flight-path optimizer (REST). Part of the
# package, not exported: the example scripts import the names they use
# (`using RobustKiteControllers: InitParams, opt_init, ...`). It leaves no
# state of its own behind; loading it neither starts nor contacts a server.
#
#     ensure_server()
#     reply  = opt_init(InitParams(; name = "run-1", length = 200.0, ...))
#     result = opt_step(StepParams(200.0, winch, reply.trajectory))
#
# Contract: POST /init receives `InitParams` and replies `InitReply`, POST /step
# receives `StepParams` and replies `StepReply` (blocking by default — the reply
# carries the optimized path). The replies are the request structs plus what only
# the server knows: the `depower` the path was optimized for, the
# `min_turn_radius` and `pattern_limits` it was optimized under, and the solve
# `metrics`. A reply trajectory is CLOSED (last point == first). Angles are
# DEGREES in these structs, and the physical state travels in them: the tether
# length is the `length` field, the wind the `inflow_conditions` field of
# `InitParams`. Call-mode knobs are keyword arguments instead —
# `opt_step(p; wait = false)` returns as soon as the solve is queued, so the
# caller keeps flying while the server optimizes, and `max_iter` caps the solve.
#
# Depower: the server OPTIMIZES `input_depower` by default, so the path that
# comes back is only flyable at the depower it was optimized for — read it from
# `reply.depower.value` (measured: 1.6 sent, 1.5186 returned). Send
# `depower = DepowerSpec("fixed", u_p)` to pin it to what the run actually flies,
# or `"profile"` for a per-node depower schedule.
#
# Turn radius and pattern box: `min_turn_radius` [m] makes the optimizer respect
# the kite's own turning limit (1/(c1*u_s_max) for a psi_dot = c1*v_a*u_s kite)
# instead of only its internal steering bounds, and `pattern_limits` bounds where
# the path may go in azimuth/elevation. Both replace checking-and-discarding a
# reply after the solve: the constrained solve is the one that costs nothing.
#
# The endpoint functions are named `opt_*` rather than `init`/`step`/`status`
# because a script that flies an optimized path also does `using V3Kite`, whose
# exported `init` builds the kite model. A second `init` in `Main` is then not a
# shadow but an error ("function V3Kite.init must be explicitly imported to be
# extended").
#
# Winch coupling: the optimizer maps `v_set = kv*sqrt(force)` onto its radial
# force model, so the path it returns assumes exactly the winch behaviour that
# `winch_from_wc` sends it.
#
# Infeasibility: an impossible request (too much force demanded, too little
# wind, a winch too stiff to reel out at the optimum) comes back as HTTP 422
# with the solver's message; the previous trajectory stays available through
# `opt_trajectory`.

the tape is let out (4486 W at 1.6 m, 1873 W at 1.8 m) and 2.0 m is infeasible

    opt_request_key(p::InitParams) -> String

Identity of a request as the SERVER sees it: every field of `p` except `name`,
which is the caller's label for the run and not part of the problem.

EVERY field has to be in here. A field left out is a false hit — a failure
recorded under one turn radius, depower mode or winch curve would block a
request that differs in exactly that, which is the one bug this cache must not
have. The hand-written field list of `"v2-"` missed six winch fields
(`softplus_beta`, `softminus_beta`, `use_awe_trim`, `v_reel_in`,
`reel_in_beta`, `winch_mode`), so `"v3-"` walks the structs instead
([`_key_fields`](@ref)): a field added to any request struct is in the key
without anyone having to remember it. The prefix retires the entries written
under the narrower keys rather than reusing them.

The project is NOT part of the key, and needs not be: the server sees only the
request, so two projects that send the same request pose the same problem and
share the entry. What the key cannot see is the server's own configuration
(kite, tether, solver defaults) — clear the cache after an AWETrim upgrade.

The key is a [`stable_hash`](@ref), not Base's `hash`, so it survives a Julia
upgrade. `"v4-"` retires the `hash`-based `"v3-"` keys.

`nothing`, tuples and vectors of them) — which [`_key_fields`](@ref) ensures.

Optimize the path for the current tether length (and optionally a new inflow).
Blocks ~10-20 s and returns a [`StepReply`](@ref): the optimized `trajectory`,
the `depower` it was optimized for, the limits it respects and the solve
`metrics` (including `turn_radius_min_m`, the tightest physical radius of the
path that came back).

`max_iter` caps the solver's iterations for this step — the one lever against a
failing solve running to IPOPT's cap, measured at 81 s against 1.5 s for a
converged one.

Every step is WARM-STARTED from the session's previous optimum; what the
`trajectory` field does is REPLACE that seed with a curve of the caller's, refitted
into the pattern B-spline. Leaving it `nothing` therefore re-anchors the last
optimum to the new `length` and solves from there — the cheap solve — while
sending one is a cold start in everything but the session.

With `wait = false` the server accepts the job and replies immediately; the
return value is the step index instead. Poll [`opt_status`](@ref) until its
`"state"` leaves `"solving"`, then collect the result with
[`opt_trajectory`](@ref) — which is in RADIANS, unlike the degrees of the
blocking reply. While a solve runs, and after one that failed, the server keeps
serving the PREVIOUS path, so a caller is never left without a curve to fly.

`raw = true` returns a blocking reply as the parsed JSON `Dict` instead, which is

`turn_radius` is the path's PHYSICAL turn radius [m] at each node (`r/|kappa|`,

`InitParams.min_turn_radius` constrains, and the one to compare with the kite's

# Solution cache: a chain of requests replayed without the server
#
# The counterpart of the failed-request cache for the requests that WORKED —
# and only for those whose result was APPLIED (installed and flown). A converged
# reply that a gate rejected is not stored as a result.
#
# A result cannot be keyed by its request alone the way a failure is. A warm
# `/step` solves from the optimum the SERVER holds, and that state is made up of
# every request since the last `/init`: each `/step` also moves the session's
# length, winch and limits, even when its solve fails. So the key is a CHAIN. A
# cold request's key is `opt_request_key` of its `InitParams`, and every step's
# key hashes its parent's key with its own `StepParams`. Equal keys mean equal
# lineage.
#
# A hit is served without asking the server, so the server no longer holds the
# state the chain has reached. The next MISS therefore first REBUILDS that state:
# `/init` under the session's current config, seeded with the cached optimum,
# then one `/step` from there. The result is close to the lost state but not
# bit-identical, because IPOPT's warm start is gone. The rebuilt state therefore
# gets a key of its own (the parent's plus "rebuilt"). Whatever is solved from it
# is stored under that lineage, so it never passes for the original. A second
# rerun hits it as well.
#
# When a chain ends in an applied result, its whole lineage since the `/init`
# is stored: every reply a warm start built on, rejected ones included, because a
# replay cannot reach the result without them. A WARM step that fails is stored
# as soon as it fails (under `opt_failure_cache`), because the failure cache above
# can only key cold requests.
#
# The key cannot see the server itself. Clear this cache
# (`clear_opt_chain_cache()`) after any AWETrim change, or a replay keeps serving
# the old optimizer's answers.

Mean reel-out power an OPTIMAL path could harvest with any winch inside
`[f_min, f_max]`, solved at `tos.server.free_speed_reference_points` lengths spanning
`lengths` and weighted by how much of the reeling window was spent at each: every
entry of `lengths` is one sample, scored at its own length, linearly interpolated
between the probes and held flat outside them. `wc` is the run's `WCSettings`
([`winch_from_wc`](@ref)), `guess_az`/`guess_el` [deg] the guess each probe is
seeded with, `min_turn_radius` and `pattern_limits` the run's constraints.

An upper bound, not a prediction of the run's `k_v` law: `winch_mode =
"free_speed"` drops the winch law entirely. Meant to be solved AFTER a run so it
cannot disturb it, and never flown — a free-speed path does not sustain the force
the winch needs. A solve that fails is skipped; `nothing` when none succeed.

Every probe goes through an [`OptChain`](@ref) of its own, not the run's, so a
rerun of the same run is served from the solution cache and the run's hit/miss
counts stay its own. A converged probe is stored as if applied: each is a cold
chain of one step, and it IS the result the caller uses.
