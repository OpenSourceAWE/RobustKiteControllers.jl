# System image build: memory and thread rules

This file describes how the system image build checks memory and chooses the number of
compilation threads (`JULIA_IMAGE_THREADS`). It is the
specification: change the rules here first, then update the scripts to match.

## Scripts

The shell script `bin/create_sys_image` runs first and starts Julia with
`examples/create_sys_image.jl`. The rules are the same as in Tethers.jl, KiteModels.jl and
KiteControllers.jl; keep the memory and thread code of the scripts identical to theirs.

## What goes into the image

When creating a system image for a package checked out with git, never add the package itself
to the system image. Instead, add all of its large dependencies. By doing so, editing the
source code of the package and using Revise stays possible, even with the system image.

A package that is loaded on top of the image can invalidate code compiled into it. HTTP
(loaded by RobustKiteControllers) and DataFrames (loaded by V3Kite) invalidated so much
GLMakie code that the first `simple_reelout_plots.jl` figures recompiled for 14 s (2026-10-23;
10 s and 4 s, measured with `--trace-compile-timing` as `# recompile` entries). Both load
fast, so the 0.2 s rule below would leave them out; `INVALIDATING` in
`examples/create_sys_image.jl` lists them anyway.

### Load times

Time of `@time using <package>` in a fresh Julia process, with `--project=examples`, without
and with the system image `bin/kps-image-1.13.so`; the shortest of three runs. Each package is
loaded alone, so its time includes loading its dependencies that are not loaded yet, and the
times don't add up. The last row loads what the example scripts need; V3Kite and
RobustKiteControllers aren't in the image, so loading them still takes about 1 s.

Packages loading in less than 0.2 s without the image are not listed in
`examples/create_sys_image.jl`; they are only in the image if a listed package depends on
them.

(Julia 1.13.2, AMD Ryzen 7 7840U, 16 CPU threads, 30 GB of RAM, Linux; 2026-10-22. On Windows
the image holds the same packages, compressed, from Julia 1.13 on; with older Julia versions
it lacks SymbolicAWEModels, so the last row would be slower there.)

## Definitions

- **RAM**: physical memory.
- **Swap**:
  - Linux: `SwapTotal` from `/proc/meminfo`.
  - Windows: the size the pagefile can grow to. For a pagefile without a maximum ("System
    managed", or `MaximumSize` 0) Windows allows up to max(3 × RAM, 4 GB), but at most 1/8 of
    the volume. If this can't be determined, the current pagefile size is used.
  - macOS: twice the free space of the volume macOS creates its swap files on
    (`/System/Volumes/VM`, or `/` if that doesn't exist) minus 5 GB, at least 0. macOS
    writes compressed memory to its swap files; the build compresses it about 2.5 : 1 (see
    below). A Mac with 8 GB of RAM thus needs about 16 GB of free disk space.
- **Total**: RAM + swap, in GB.
- **GB**: 1024³ bytes. The shell scripts work in MB (1024² bytes); a 16 GB machine reports
  a little less than 16384 MB, so "16 GB" is tested as 15000 MB.

## Rules

### 1. Shell script

1. Linux only, before doing anything else: if the total < 30 GB (30720 MB), stop with an
   error ("Increase your swap file and retry"). On Windows and macOS the swap can grow, so
   the Julia script checks this.
2. If `JULIA_IMAGE_THREADS` is already set, keep it in all later steps.
3. Read RAM (MB):
   - Linux: `MemTotal` from `/proc/meminfo`
   - macOS: `sysctl -n hw.memsize`
   - Windows: `Win32_ComputerSystem.TotalPhysicalMemory`
4. Minimum RAM: 15 GB (15000 MB) on Linux and Windows, 7 GB (7000 MB) on macOS, so that
   Macs with 8 GB of RAM can build the image. Below that, stop with an error, before
   instantiating or precompiling anything. If RAM can't be read, warn and continue.
5. If `JULIA_IMAGE_THREADS` is not set, on all platforms:
   - RAM < 27 GB (26674 MB on Linux, 27000 MB on macOS and Windows) → 2 threads, or 1 if the
     machine has fewer than 4 CPU threads (`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`).
   - RAM unknown → 1 thread.

### 2. Julia script

1. Compute the total (RAM + swap) as defined above.
   On Windows all limits of the total in this section and in the table below are 5 GB higher
   (`EXTRA_RAM_WINDOWS`): with two threads the build reached a commit charge of 37.3 GB there.
2. Total < 30 GB: stop with an error on all platforms. The message says what to increase:
   the pagefile (Windows), free disk space (macOS) or the swap file (Linux).
3. 30 GB ≤ total < 34 GB: use 1 thread on all platforms, also if the shell script chose 2.
   A value set by the caller is kept.
4. Otherwise, if `JULIA_IMAGE_THREADS` is set (by the caller or by the shell script), keep it.
5. Otherwise (total ≥ 34 GB), on all platforms: `clamp(Sys.CPU_THREADS ÷ 2, 1, 16)` threads.

### Resulting behaviour

Without `JULIA_IMAGE_THREADS` set by the caller:

| Platform       | Condition                                 | Result                                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Linux, Windows | RAM < 15 GB                               | error                                       |
| macOS          | RAM < 7 GB                                | error                                       |
| all            | total < 30 GB                             | error                                       |
| all            | 30 GB ≤ total < 34 GB                     | 1 thread                                    |
| all            | RAM ≥ minimum, RAM < 27 GB, total ≥ 34 GB | 2 threads (1 with fewer than 4 CPU threads) |
| all            | RAM ≥ 27 GB, total ≥ 34 GB                | half the CPU threads, at most 16            |

## Where the numbers come from

Peak memory demand (RAM used + swap used, without counting zram pages twice, including the
operating system) from the AWEMeta.jl GitHub workflows, on GitHub runners with 16 GB of RAM
and 36 GB of swap (zram + swap file), 4 CPU threads:

| Image                                 | Workflow | Julia  | Threads | Peak (GB)  |
|---------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| KiteModels#main (`create_sys_image`)  | KM2      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.6, 26.3 |
| KiteModels#main (`create_sys_image2`) | KM3      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.0, 24.8 |
| KiteModels release                    | KM4      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.6, 24.9 |
| KiteModels release                    | KM4      | 1.12.7 | 1       | 22.6, 22.2 |
| Tethers#main                          | TE1      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.1, 23.8 |
| KiteControllers#main                  | KC3      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.6, 25.3 |
| KiteControllers#main `--update`       | KC4      | 1.13.2 | 1       | 25.8, 25.6 |

(Runs of 2026-10-19 and 2026-10-20; GB = 1024 MB.)

Tethers.jl also measured (AWEMeta TE2/TE3 and a local run) about 30 GB with two image
threads, and about the same up to 16 threads. More than two threads cost no extra memory, so
the thread count doesn't grow with the memory.

On macOS (AWEMeta TE2: Tethers#main, GitHub runner with an Apple M1, 3 CPU threads and 7 GB
of RAM, Julia 1.13.2, one thread) the image compiled in about 1.5 hours (40 minutes on the
16 GB Linux runner). At the peak 9.5 GB of swap was used. The memory compressor held 34.3 GB
of memory in 3.8 GB of RAM plus the 9.5 GB of swap, a ratio of 2.6; during the build the
ratio was between 2.1 and 2.6. Hence the free disk space counts twice. The uncompressed
demand at the peak (active + wired + pages stored in the compressor) was 36.4 GB, more than
the about 26 GB on Linux; whether the two numbers are comparable is not known. (Run of
2026-10-20; GB = 1024 MB.)

- With one thread the KiteModels.jl image needs about the same as the Tethers.jl image: at
  most 26.3 GB, on Julia 1.13. Julia 1.12 needs about 3 GB less.
- 30 GB minimum: the one-thread peak plus a few GB of margin. For KiteModels.jl the margin is
  about 3.7 GB.
- There are no measurements of the KiteModels.jl image with more than one thread: the shell
  script forced one thread on the 16 GB runners.
- With one thread the KiteControllers.jl image needs about the same as the KiteModels.jl
  image: at most 25.8 GB, a margin of about 4.2 GB to the 30 GB minimum. The peak occurs
  while the image is compiled, not while the tests run.
- There are no measurements of the KiteControllers.jl image with more than one thread
  either; on the 16 GB runners the shell script forced one thread.

No GC heap-size hint is set. `--heap-size-hint` on the command line of the shell script
would limit only the Julia process that drives PackageCompiler, not the processes it starts
for the precompile script and for compiling the image, where the peak memory demand occurs:
child processes don't inherit the flag (checked on Julia 1.12.7 and 1.13.2). The environment
variable `JULIA_HEAP_SIZE_HINT` would be inherited, but its effect on the build hasn't been
measured.
