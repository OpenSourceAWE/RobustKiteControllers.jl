The model side of the example scripts, which the package cannot hold because it
does not depend on V3Kite (see `oldplans/Plan_refactor_opt_reelout.md`). Included at the
top of `simple_fig8.jl`, `simple_fig8_live.jl`, `simple_opt_fig8.jl`, `simple_reelout.jl`
and `simple_opt_reelout.jl`, into the same module; the last one hands `init_model` to
`setup_run`.

The model, initialized and settled: `init` at the project's wind and tether length,
`sim_time` long, with `warmup_torque` holding the length during the warm-up (by default
the winch loop `wpc`; pass the force hold when the run flies the winch in FORCE mode).
With `pad_final_time` the run gets room for a full phase 5 (`fcs.reelout.final_time`) past
`sim_time`; a `sim_time` of `nothing` falls back to the project's own value, unpadded.
`set_overrides` are applied to the model's own `Settings` afterwards, e.g. `v_steering`,
the tape's rate limit. `aero_mode` is `ContinuousAero()` or `AeroDirect()`;
`damping_per_stiffness` [s] is the tether/bridle structural damping as a ratio of
stiffness, see `simple_fig8.jl`'s docstring.

The wing drag of the project's kite settings is applied after settling and before
the warm-up, see [`apply_wing_drag!`](@ref).

Apply the `wing_drag_coeff` of `project`'s `kite_settings:` file to the model `s`,
which V3Kite's `init` reads but does not apply: `distribute_wing_drag!` splits the
projected wing area equally over the wing nodes, each with that drag coefficient.
`0` adds none. The kernel backend re-syncs point parameters every step, so the drag
acts from the next step on. Every model this package flies goes through it,
`init_model` and the relay flights of `build_turn_rate_table.jl` alike, so the turn-rate
law is identified on the plant the runs fly.
