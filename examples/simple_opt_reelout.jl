Reel out along a path an EXTERNAL OPTIMIZER produced, instead of along a
lemniscate.

`simple_reelout.jl` with one block added — read that file's docstring for the
winch, the entry state machine, the log slots and the stop criteria, which all
apply unchanged. What differs is the reference path: the AWETrim optimizer is
asked for the power-optimal reel-out path under THIS run's wind and winch, and
`set_path!` installs it. [`simple_opt_fig8.jl`](simple_opt_fig8.jl) was the
rehearsal, flying the same path at constant length.

# Predicted versus measured power

The optimizer predicts a mean reel-out power for its path; reeling out along it
measures one. Both land in the `traj_opt:` section of the run summary with their
ratio. A large gap is the finding, not a bug to hide. Phases 3 and 4 also fly
the optimizer's depower, ramped in over `path_blend_time`; phase 5 always flies `fcs.reelout.depower_final`.

# Re-optimizing while the tether grows

Re-optimization re-anchors the path to the length actually flown:
a request every `reopt_every_n_laps` laps, at most `max_reopt` times, polled via
`/status` and collected from `opt_trajectory` (its table is in RADIANS). While a
solve runs or after one fails, the server keeps serving the previous path.

The run sends `/init` once and re-optimizes with `/step` alone, WARM-STARTING from the previous optimum
re-anchored to the new length — cheaper, but it follows one branch of a
multi-modal problem and the failure cache cannot key it; with `reopt_blocking`,
a failed warm step falls back to one cold `/init`. The FLOWN path is never fed back as a seed: optimized
for a much shorter radius, it degrades as the run walks out and the solve escapes
to near-zenith (measured 2026-08-18: repeated failures from ~210 m, while the
guess converges at every length tried).

`reopt_blocking = true` (default) freezes the loop for the 7-13 s solve so the
reply matches the length asked for; the frozen time is reported as
`traj_opt.reopt.blocked` and excluded from `performance.realtime_factor`.
`false` flies on, anchoring the reply ~24 m behind at 2.4 m/s.

A candidate is checked for curvature, clearance and elevation AT THE CURRENT
LENGTH, at its OWN resolution (the flown path is resampled to `n_path`; upsampling
a coarse polyline makes the curvature check read too tight). A rejected candidate
is dropped and the run keeps flying what it has. One that passes is aligned with
[`prepare_path`](@ref) and blended in over `path_blend_time`
([`blend_paths`](@ref)), so the reference never steps and the lap counter is
re-based in the same move. Every solve is recorded in `traj_opt.reopt`.

# Lifting the path

The kite tracks BELOW the path it is given (1-2 deg, 3.5 deg at 380 m).
`fcs.reelout.el_offset_final` adds a fixed lift once reel-out ends — a setpoint move for
clearance. It latches at the STOP LATCH (the run's lowest point falls between
latch and phase 4 -> 5), or, with `reelout_softstop` at 0, once the length left
is under `v_reelout * el_offset_lead`. It reaches the kite through the next path
install or, when none is due, as a blend onto the path in the air, gated on the
curvature margin and rationed down to a quarter of it if the whole lift is
refused; the remainder waits in `el_target - el_applied` and is retried next lap.

`fcs.reelout.el_offset_wing` lifts the LOBES only, because the sag is deeper there than
at the crossing; it is baked into every installed path and rationed the same way.

Every lift is flown narrower, so the pattern-SIZE criteria break first;
`traj_opt.lift_budget` in the summary puts the lift bought against the room each
size criterion has left.

# Why the curvature margin is checked where it is

For ONE path flown all the way out, the start is the worst case: the angular
turn radius `1/(L*c1*u_s)` only shrinks with length, so the startup check runs
at the starting length, and phase 5 is checked separately at `reelout_l_max`
under `depower_final` (`margin5`, `c1_at_phase`). With re-optimization every
request is the worst case instead: the PHYSICAL radius `1/(c1*u_s)` =
11.35 m is length-independent, so each candidate is checked against the c1 of
the phase it will be flown in.

The margin is no longer only a gate. `min_feasibility_margin` is also SENT with
every request as a minimum turn radius (`min_turn_radius_request`, scaled up by
`turn_radius_headroom` and the lap's reel-out), so the optimizer solves under the
limit its reply will be judged by. A 422 from the server, not a rejected reply,
is now the expected failure. A startup reply that still falls short is re-solved
by `retry_startup!`, up to `STARTUP_RETRIES_MAX` times: each attempt is a warm
`/step` under one changed lever (`next_lever`: turn radius, elevation ceiling or
width), never a different seed.

# What comes from where

Optimizer settings — server, initial guess, solver knobs, resampling, margin —
are `data/traj_opt.yaml` ([`TrajOptSettings`](@ref)). The CONDITIONS come from
the system project's settings file (wind) and its `wc_settings` (winch law) via
`inflow_from_settings` and `winch_from_wc`. The guess decides whether and where
the solve converges, so it is only moved when the server refuses: a startup 422
is re-sent from guess centres shifted by `startup_retry_el_offsets` (see
[`solve_startup`](@ref)), and a failed blocking warm step once as a cold `/init`
from the guess. A startup path that converges but is too tight keeps its seed (`retry_startup!`).
See `simple_opt_fig8.jl` for the measurements. `fcs.pattern.f8_a`/`f8_b`/`el_center` are NOT
flown here; the pattern's centre and extent are measured off the installed path.

# Globals

The run keeps two: `setup` (see `setup_run`), everything it reads, and `st`, the
`RunState` everything it writes. The setup and the startup are the package's
(`src/run_setup.jl`, `src/startup_path.jl`): the script hands `setup_with_startup`
its `init_model` (`model_setup.jl`), since the package does not depend on the model,
which sets the run up again at a longer tether when the startup finds no path
(`startup_retry_length_steps`), and calls the remaining startup steps in order. `startup_feasibility` (the gates of
[`check_startup_path`](@ref)) adds `feas`, `margin5`, `c1_at_phase` and
`phase5_margin_at` to `setup`. Left here are the loop around the model's `step!`
(`run_loop!`) and `reelout_results.jl` (scoring, summary YAML, archive, plots,
finished-run marker). Besides `setup` and `st` only `REF_PATH` and `LOG_NAME`
(for the plots) and the timers `t_script_start`, `run_script`, `t_wall` and
`t_sim` are left in `Main`.

Logs to `output/<log_file>_opt.arrow` and `_opt.yaml`, leaving the lemniscate
run's files intact for comparison. `REF_PATH` and `LOG_NAME` carry the flown
curve and that name to `simple_reelout_plots.jl`.

The simulation loop: steps the model `s` until its steps or the reel-out and phase 5 are over.
Everything it writes lives in `st`; the run's settings and controllers (`fcs`, `tos`, `s`, `rc`, ...)
come in `setup` (see `setup_run`), unchanged during the loop. Passed as an argument, not read as a global, so the loop compiles against their concrete
types. `reelout_results.jl` reads `st` afterwards. The `try` stays at the call, so the wall time survives
an early `break` or a throw. What happens before and after `step!` is the package's
(`step_commands!`, `record_step!`, `src/reelout_loop.jl`); only the model calls are here.
