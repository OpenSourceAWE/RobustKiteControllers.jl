"""
Fly the V3 kite along a path an EXTERNAL OPTIMIZER produced, at constant tether
length.

Same plant, entry and inner loop as `simple_fig8.jl` — read that file first, its
docstring covers the log slots, the parameters, the sign conventions and why the
pattern must be flown low and wide, all of which apply here unchanged. What
differs is where the reference path comes from: instead of the lemniscate
`fcs.pattern.f8_a`/`f8_b` describe, the AWETrim optimizer is asked for the
power-optimal reel-out path under THIS run's wind and winch, and `set_path!`
installs it. The lemniscate is still built — as the initial guess the optimizer
starts from, and as the reference the result is plotted against.

# What this stage does and does not test

The optimized path is a REEL-OUT path: the optimizer maximizes reel-out power
and assumes the winch law `v_set = kv*sqrt(force)` of `data/wc_settings.yaml`.
This script flies it at CONSTANT length, so the winch coupling is not exercised
and the power the optimizer predicts is not the power this run harvests. What it
does establish, for the price of one short run, is that the guidance tracks an
arbitrary closed curve as well as it tracks its own lemniscate — everything else
is built on that. `simple_reelout.jl`'s successor closes the loop
(PlanOptFig8.md, stage 3).

# The server

`ensure_server()` starts one (`bin/run_server start`) if none answers, so a run
does not fail because a terminal was closed; `base_url` is in
`data/traj_opt.yaml` with the rest of the optimizer's settings. The
request is built by
`inflow_from_settings(project_set)` and `winch_from_wc(wcs)`, from the same files
the plant is built from: a path optimized for another wind, or for a winch three
times softer than the real one, is not the path for this run.

# The initial guess is not a formality

The guess lemniscate seeds the solve and nothing else — it does not shape the
flown path — and it has its own `guess_*` fields in `data/traj_opt.yaml` rather
than reusing `fcs.pattern.f8_a`/`f8_b`/`el_center`, which size the pattern the OTHER runs
actually fly. It decides two things, both measured on 2026-08-18 at 150 m and
6 m/s:
**whether the solve converges at all** (the reel-out settings' 20°/11° at 18°
give an IPOPT failure, while 30°/12°, or the same eight centred at 26°,
converge), and **which optimum it converges to** (those three all reach 6080 W,
while the server's own parametric lemniscate guess converges to a different,
much flatter 1431 W solution). The problem is multi-modal, so a guess is a
choice about the answer, and this script therefore never retries with a
different one behind your back: a 422 stops the run and says what to try.

Two things are checked before anything is flown, both of which cost a run
otherwise. The optimizer knows nothing of the V3's turn-rate law, so
`check_pattern_feasible` is evaluated on the path it RETURNED; and a winch too
stiff to reel out at the optimum makes the problem infeasible, which arrives as
HTTP 422 and is translated into the speed ceiling `kv*sqrt(f_high)` that caused
it. The traversal direction is asserted too: `set_path!` reverses a path to match
`up_loops`, so a `downloops` mismatch would otherwise silently fly the optimizer's
curve backwards — the same curve, but not the one that was optimized.

# Geometry that no longer comes from `FC_Settings`

`fcs.pattern.f8_a`/`f8_b` and `fcs.pattern.el_center` describe the guess, not what is flown, so
the pattern's centre (the dive target, and `var_04`) and its extent (the size
criteria of `fig8_metrics`) are measured off the installed path instead.

Logs to `output/<log_file>.arrow` like `simple_fig8.jl`, and to the same name:
this is the same run under the same project, and the last one flown is the one
plotted. `REF_PATH` carries the flown curve to `simple_fig8_plots.jl`, which
would otherwise redraw the lemniscate as the reference.
