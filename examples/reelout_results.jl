    reelout_results.jl — scoring, summary, archive and plots of an optimized reel-out run.

`include`d by `simple_opt_reelout.jl` before its last step, which calls
[`reelout_results`](@ref) once the log has been saved. It reads the run's
`setup` (`fcs`, `tos`, ...) and its `RunState` `st` (`st.reopt_events`,
`st.el_applied`, `st.opt_power_pred`, ...), reloads the log, prints the results
block, writes the summary YAML next to it, copies both plus every input YAML
into a timestamped archive folder, draws the plots and writes the finished-run
marker. Nothing here touches the plant, so a change to it is checked by
re-scoring an existing log rather than by flying again.

Every step is a function of its own; `reelout_results` runs them in order and
leaves no globals behind but `REF_PATH` and `LOG_NAME`, the plots' hand-over.

pattern-size criteria. Returns the log `sl`, `fig8m`, the laps flown and the

    power_comparison(setup, st, sl, rp, p4) -> NamedTuple

The comparison this script exists for: what the optimizer promised against what
reeling out delivered, as the `traj_opt.power` block. `rp` is `nothing` when the
tether never reeled out, and then there is nothing to compare.

The prediction is a WEIGHTED one whenever a re-optimization installed a path. Each
path carries its own `avg_power_W`, and the run flies each for part of the reeling
window, so scoring the whole window against the FIRST path's number compares the
measurement to a path that was not in the air for some of it. `rp.idx` is that
window's samples, so every share (`weighted_prediction`) is measured over exactly
the samples `measured_W` averages. Adds the free-speed upper bound (`free_speed_reference`)
where the ratio is notable and the force low. The measured power goes to
`st.opt_power_meas` for the finished-run marker.
